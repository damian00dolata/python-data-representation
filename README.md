# python-data-representation

In both tasks images are generated from numerical data. In the *plots* catalog there are files generating plots, and in the *map* catalog there are files generating gradients on the basis of HSV model, which are then applicated on maps.

Both programs are compiled in Python - the main files are: *plot.py*, *gradient.py* and *map.py*.
